Q: What happens when you initialize a repository. Why do you need to do it?
A: Git sets up neccesary files for you. It is needed to make a repository.

Q: How is staging area different from the working directory and the repository. What values
do you think it offers?
A: The staging area seems to work as a temporary place to add additions and changes before
you want to make a commit. It takes the file in the directory you want to add to the
repository.

Q How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A The staging area gives you fine grained controls to what to put in a commit. You don't
have to stage every changed file, so its easier to only select the code that fits in
one logical commit.

Q: What are some situatioins when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
A: Branches can help organized experimental features and ideas that you havent quite
nailed down yet, allowing you to experiment without cluttering you main branch.

Q: How do the diagrams help visualize the branch structure?
A: I am usually not very big on visualizing conecpts, but I can see that git branching
can be messy. It will help a lot in keeping track of the structure of you repository.

Q: What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the
diagram the way we do?
A: The result is a new 'HEAD' that represent the changes from two branches. It is
represented the way it is two reflect which changes/commits were done in the different
branches.
