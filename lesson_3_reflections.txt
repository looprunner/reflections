Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When collaborating with other people. When doing work on remote machines or over several machines. Remote repositories
makes you work more mobile and easier to share.

Q: Why migh you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with
your remote repository
A: The changes on remote may not always be desireable and not fit in to what you are working on right now. I can
be better to have control over what gets pulled, and automatic pulll leaves room for more unexpected situations.

Q: Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?
A: A clone is a copy of a repository, living in a seperate space. A fork is a clone on
Github. It is the same as a clone. A branch lives inside a repository. You fork or clone
a project when you want to make your own changes to it, but don't neccesarly want the
changes to appear in the original project. A branch is more for personal use when you
want to explore new features or ideas inside your project.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: It is good to have the most up to date code. If you have the last known state it can 
be easier to merge later.
